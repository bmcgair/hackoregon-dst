This is a small for of Jeroen Janssens data-science-toolbox to support the HackOregon project.

How to build:

Install ansible and packer.
Clone this repository locally.
cd to the build directory
set your aws credentials and account info in the variables.json file
Make sure you have the right credentials in ~/.aws/credentials too
./build.sh

On the first run the build script will download the ubuntu server ISO.
This might take a very long time, so I'd suggest not deleting it.
